        <h4>Kerala is situated at the southwestern end of the Indian subcontinent. Kerala has a long history of art and cultural heritage and foreign trade with other countries. The state with the highest literacy rate in India is noted for its achievements in education, health, gender equality, social justice, law and order. In addition to these, the state has the lowest infant mortality rate in the country.

          Kerala lies between the Arabian Sea in the West and the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) in the East with an area of 38863 sq km. It is one of the five states in the linguistic-cultural area known as South India. The neighbouring states of Kerala are Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Mayyazhi (Mahe / Mahe) is a part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea is part of the Union Territories, it has a close alliance with the linguistic and cultural heritage of Kerala.

                <h3 class="card-title1">Administration of Kerala</h3>
                <p class="card-text">Kerala is a state in the Democratic Union of India, so same set of political rules is set for it too as the rest of the country. The Governor is the constitutional head of the state and the post is held by former Chief Justice of India Mr. P. Sathasivam, on the other hand Chief Minister represents the people of Kerala in the Parliament and the post is taken by Mr. Oommen Chandy. Kerala is well known for its incredible literacy rate, and for a general excellence in the public towards its civic duties. Voter turnouts for the state are consistently above the 70% mark, and the state has a decidedly leftist inclination when it comes to politics.

                  Communism has many supporters in Kerala, and the Left Democratic Front, which is one of the two major political outfits in Kerala, is led by the Communist Party of India. At the moment, Kerala has the United Democratic Front in power, which is being led by the Indian National Congress. Bharatiya Janata Party, which is currently in power in the Centre with complete majority, has a negligible presence in Kerala, and has to contend with being the biggest of the minor parties in the state. </p>

              <h3 class="card-title1">Cuisines of Kerala</h3>
              <p class="card-text">The spectacular array of dishes that are offered to the visitors in Kerala will blow anyone's mind. Being a coastal area, sea food is found in abundance but this hardly means that those who only eat vegetarian food will feel left out. Since the land has been welcoming travellers from every corner of the world, tastes of all these different lands have mixed with the local flavour to create a delightful culinary surprise. Coconut is used extensively while making the food, and so are the spices that are grown locally and allow for incredible flavours.

                There is a distinct difference between the culinary styles of the food that you will get to eat in Kochi, Malabar, and Travancore. This is due to the fact that the three were different provinces before Independence, and hence had uniquely different styles which were restricted to their respective kingdoms.

            <p class="card-text">The Human Development index in Kerala is very high, leading to quality services for healthcare in the state. The Ayurvedic form of medicine is widely practiced in the state, and modern practices such as allopathy are easily available at government hospitals and private clinics.

              The government has introduced a number of health schemes in the state in order to offer even better medical assistance. Year 2013 saw the inauguration of two such schemes at the hands of Mrs Sonia Gandhi:
              Arogya Kiranam Scheme
              Distribution of free generic medicine

                <h3 class="card-title1">Business and Economy of Kerala</h3>
                <p class="card-text">The economy of Kerala is dominated by the service industry and the state is ahead of most of the states in terms of per capita GDP and economic productivity. The economy has been a strong suit for Kerala since the earliest of times. The global spice route passed right through the state, and older ports like Muziris were amongst the busiest in the world. The spice trade was such a major influencer for the economy, that not only did it impact and help Kerala grow at a phenomenal rate, it was directly responsible for a huge bulk of the world economy as well. With a recorded GDP of Rupees 1624 billion for the year 2004-05, and the economy steadily flourishing ever since, Kerala has a solid infrastructure, and a booming economy which continues to flourish and bolster even further today.

                  Much of the economic growth in Kerala post Independence has occurred when the state was still being operated as democratic socialist welfare. Many of the cumbersome and restrictive License Raj restrictions of such a political structure were lifted in the 1990s, and has allowed a number of industries to make inroads into the state. The impact of these revisions in the economic structure was astounding, and post the relaxation, the economy of the state flourished at a virtually unprecedented rate. Kerala exceeds the national growth rate today by a wide margin, and stands at 8.93% growth for the year 1988-2005, whereas, the national average for the same period was a much lower 4.80%. This is often referred to as the Kerala Model of Development, yielded terrific results for the overall human development has been credited to the sudden influx of investment in the service sector of the state, which includes tourism.
                  
                  Kerala not only has a phenomenal literacy rate, it also has a large number of expatriates living in the Gulf countries, who left the state and moved abroad during the 70s and 80s, when the boom in the region was significant, and attracted job seekers from all over the world. A large part of the state's economy is also dependent on these expatriates and their remittance.
                  
                  Tourism has a major impact on the economy of Kerala as well, and the state sees millions of visitors from domestic states as well as international destinations on a regular basis. The famous backwaters of the state, as well as the many ashrams here are a major source of tourism revenue for Kerala.</p>
